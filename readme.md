## Building

Building is currently tested on the following targets:

- x86-64 linux using the GCC compiler
- x86-64 windows using MSVC and Visual Studio 2022 Community*

*The Visual Studio Project assumes that you have sourced the vendor libraries yourself and put them in the "vendor" folder. Please do so before building.

Building is currently **NOT** tested on the following targets:

- x86-64 windows using non-MSVC compiler
- all other targets not mentioned here.

Please contact for licensing. I'm always interested in collaborating, especially with others who may have a better grasp on porting games to other platforms.
